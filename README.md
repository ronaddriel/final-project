My Reflection:
	This project was a lot of fun to work on; when I first took this class, I had no idea how to code in JavaScript, but I was able to get the hang of it while working on this final. Of course, I had a little help from the websites Stack Overflow and ChatGPT to help me get through this project. I also learned how to use useEffect to fetch data and useNavigate to manage routing. Coding the backend was definitely a challenge for me because javascript was a learning curve, but frontend was a completely different story. I had to use an older version of PostCSS because it was not working properly. It took me a full day to simply install the dependencies for this project. But once I figured it out, everything went smoothly from there! Overall, this project was eye-opening for me because seeing my project come to fruition was both enjoyable and rewarding. I'd love to learn more about web development and design.
